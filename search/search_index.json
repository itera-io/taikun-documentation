Kubernetes </p> <p>Kubernetes Profile - a profile for enabling kubernetes function and features (such as Octavia, Load Balancer or Proxy on bastion)</p> <p>Load Balancer -  refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.</p> <p>Metrics - measure specific characteristics in a countable manner. Metrics are used in monitoring and billing.</p> <p>Monitoring - is the process to gather metrics about the operations, to ensure everything functions as expected to support applications and services. By enabling monitoring you can see Logs, Alerts or Metrics.</p> <p>Node - a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Nodes</p> <p>Octavia - exposes the Service externally using the load balancers from OpenStack.</p> <p>Pod - the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes. A pod encapsulates one or more applications.

Of course, you will need to use valid SSH keys. If you do not wish to create your own, here is a public key value you can use:</p> <pre><code>ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB/8P0zXmI/Il81+/fnvGrf0X/VyNTrOJ9nQCxBxjc5m taikun\n</code></pre>  Important <p>Within one access profile, the names of SSH users must be unique.</p>  <p>You can now declare the taikun_access_profile resource in task5.tf. You will use for_each in a slightly different manner as ssh_user is a nested resource within the access_profile resource. Here is the documen- tation of the access profile resource.</p> <p>The access profile\u2019s requirements are:    \u2022 It should use the DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1.    \u2022 It should use the NTP server time.windows.com.    \u2022 It should include all the SSH users defined in users.auto.tfvars.</p>  Tip <p>While reading access profile\u2019s schema, you may notice dns_server and ntp_server are of the type Block List.</p> <p>Going back to the pizza order example, here is how block lists are used. Suppose the pizza_order resource has an argument extra_topping defined as such:</p> <pre><code> - extra_topping (Block List, Max: 5) List of extra pizza toppings. (see below for nested\n schema)\n\n Nested Schema for extra_topping\n Required:\n - name (String) Name of the extra topping\n - quantity (Number) Quantity\n</code></pre> <p>Here is how Alice could add mozzarella di bufala and basil to her amatriciana pizza order.</p> <pre><code>resource \"pizza_order\" \"orders\" {\n  client = \"alice\"\n  type = \"amatriciana\"\n  size = \"large\"\n\n  extra_topping {\n    name = \"basil leaves\"\n    quantity = 8\n  }\n  extra_topping {\n    name = \"bufala slices\"\n    quantity = 4\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>   Note <p>The code to define the SSH users of the access profile is provided below. However, if you wish to give it a go yourself first, here is how.</p> <p>To define the ssh_user argument, you will need to use a dynamic block with the for_each keyword. You will also need to extract the list of all SSH users from the users variable. for expressions and the flatten function will be of use.</p>  <p>Spoiler ahead!</p> <p>Solution: Add the following dynamic \"ssh_user\" block to your access profile\u2019s configuration.</p> <pre><code>resource \"taikun_access_profile\" \"...\" {\n\n   # Rest of configuration: DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.\n   # ...\n\n   dynamic \"ssh_user\" {\n     for_each = flatten([for user in var.users : user.ssh_users])\n     content {\n       name = ssh_user.value.name\n       public_key = ssh_user.value.public_key\n     }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Once you have fully declared the access profile resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.</p>","title":"Task 5: Access Profile"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-6-project","text":"Note <p>For this task, please write all your code in the file task6.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</p>  <p>Finally, you can declare a project resource. However, as flavors must be bound to the project, you must first fetch a list of suitable flavors.</p> <p>To do this, declare a flavors datasource. Datasources, as opposed to resources, only fetch information from providers and do not create any resources. Add the following block to task6.tf.</p> <pre><code>data \"taikun_flavors\" \"small\" {\n# FIXME\n}\n</code></pre>  Tip <p>As you are declaring a datasource and not a resource, the block begins with the keyword data instead of resource. Once again, the type of datasource is in lowercase and must be prefixed by the name of the provider. Finally, the label \"small\" is used to designate this datasource.</p>  <p>Edit the datasource to search for flavors with 4 or fewer CPUs and no more than 8GB of RAM. Set its cloud credential ID to that of the cloud credential created in Task 3: Cloud Credentials.</p> <p>Then declare a local value flavors to be the list of names of the flavors read by the datasource. See the Terraform documentation to know more about local values.</p> <pre><code>locals {\n  flavors = [for flavor in data.taikun_flavors.small.flavors : flavor.name]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This will allow you to refer to the list of flavor names with local.flavors, which will be useful when defining the project.</p> <p>You now have everything you need to create a project in Taikun. Here is its documentation.</p> <p>These are the requirements for the project resource:   \u2022 As all previous resources, it must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization.   \u2022 It must use the kubernetes profile defined in Task 1: Kubernetes Profile.   \u2022 Its alerting profile must be the one defined in Task 2: Slack Configuration &amp; Alerting Profile.   \u2022 It should use the cloud credentials defined in Task 3: Cloud Credentials.   \u2022 Monitoring must be enabled.   \u2022 It should have one bastion, one kubemaster and one kubeworker.</p>  Tip <p>To access the first element of a list, use the syntax list[index]. For example, to get the first flavor read by the flavors datasource, use local.flavors[0].</p>  <p>After creating a project with Terraform, one may want to know its access IP. Once you have declared the project resource, add the following output block to task6.tf.</p> <pre><code>output \"project_access_ip\" {\n  value = resource.taikun_project.&lt;project-label&gt;.access_ip\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure to replace  with the label you gave your project. This will display the project\u2019s access IP once it has been created.-  Tip <p>Output values are a way for the user to output a specific value from Terraform\u2019s state.</p> <p>An output value block begins with the keyword output followed by a unique label. By setting the value argument, the user can decide which value to output.</p> <p>To know more about output values, see Terraform\u2019s documentation.</p>  <p>You can now apply your changes; expect to wait about 30 minutes for your project to be in Ready state.</p>","title":"Task 6: Project"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-7-project-user-attachments","text":"Note <p>For this task, please write all your code in the file task7.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</p>  <p>Now that your project is in Ready state, you can attach some users to it.</p> <p>Declare a project user attachment resource with the following for_each argument, replacing  with the label you gave the taikun_user resource. <pre><code>for_each = {\n  for user in resource.taikun_user.&lt;label&gt; : user.id =&gt; user\n  if user.role == \"User\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>With this block, you will be able to attach only users with the User role to the project.

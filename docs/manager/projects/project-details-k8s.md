  <figcaption>Fig .1: Accessing project's details</figcaption>
</figure>

## **Project Info**

Under **Servers** title is a brief description of the project - such as *Project*, *Project Status*, *Cloud Type*, *Kubernetes Version*, *Access Profile*, *Cloud Credentials*, *Kubernetes Profile*, *Alerting Profile*, *Policy Profile*, *Access IP Address* (if you use this address to ssh connect, please do not use user ubuntu, it's in use by Taikun for managing the cluster) and *Kubernetes Health*. Some of these include links to e.g. cloud or profiles.

<figure markdown>
  ![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/manager/projects/project-details/project-info.png "Project Info")
  <figcaption>Fig .2: Brief project info</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also see here ETC=Estimated Time to Complete. It is approx time (in minutes) until the cluster will be completed.

![ETC](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/manager/projects/project-details/etc.png "ETC")

## **Servers**

Every server is described by *ID*, *Server Name*, *IP Address*, *Flavor*, *CPU/RAM/Disk Size*, *Role*, *Status,* *K8s Health*, *Created* and *Actions*. If you expand the table, you can see *Created By*, *Last Modified* and *Last Modified By*.

![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/icons/reboot.png "Reboot"){: .middle} Reboot - choose HARD or SOFT reboot for each server

* HARD - the power to the system is physically turned off and back again causing an initial boot
* SOFT - system restarts without the need to interrupt the power

???+ info
    Hard or soft reboot can be chosen only for Openstack.
    For AWS and Azure there is only simple reboot available.

## **Action Buttons**

### **Upgrade**

Upgrade your version of Kubespray to the latest one. The button is disabled, if your Kubernetes are up to date. Enabling [auto upgrade](../creating-a-new-project) during the project creation, the Upgrade button won't be available.


### **Enable/Disable Backup**

You can *Enable Backup* if you have added the credentials in [**Backup Credentials**](../../backup-credentials) and the project isn't locked. You can do it during the project creation or after the project is created, more info [**here**](../../../guidelines/backup-monitoring-lock-reboot#enable-disable-backup).

After you enable the backup, you get notified through Notification and you can check the successful status in Kubernetes. In Projects - Kubernetes - *Deployment* section you should see *velero* installed.

<figure markdown>
  ![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/manager/projects/project-details/velero.gif "Velero tool")
  <figcaption>Fig .4: Velero tool</figcaption>
</figure>

After enabling backup, you need to add [**Backup Policies**](#backup-policy).

### **Enforce Policies**

If you haven't chosen *Policy Profile* during [project creation](../creating-a-new-project), you can do it after project is created.

First create a new profile in [**Policy Profiles**](../../policy-profiles) and then *enforce the policy*.

<figure markdown>
  ![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/manager/policy-profiles/enforce-policy.gif "Enforce policy")
  <figcaption>Fig .5: Enforce policy</figcaption>
</figure>

Disable the policy the same way.

### **Enable/Disable Monitoring**

Be able to see detailed processes with enabling monitoring. After you enable it, which takes up to 5 minutes, you can preview all tracks with [**Logs**](#logs) button. The tracking starts the moment Logs button is enabled.

You can enable monitoring before project creation or (if you forgot or have changed your mind) whenever your project is created.

Disable function works the same.

### **Commit**

Sends the changes to repository.

Once the cluster is committed you will see [**ETC**](#project-info) in project info.

### **Repair**

When the server/s are *Failed* or there is some other problem in the cluster, use repair button.

<figure markdown>
  ![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/partner/projects/project-details/repair.gif "Repair")
  <figcaption>Fig .6: Repair</figcaption>
</figure>

### **Attach/Detach Alerting Profile**

Attach [**Alerting Profile**](../../alerting-profiles) if you want to receive a notifications about alerts in your project. Detach if notifications are no longer needed.

### **Lock/Unlock**

![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/icons/lock.png "lock"){: .middle} **Lock**/![](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/icons/unlock.png "unlock"){: .middle} **Unlock**

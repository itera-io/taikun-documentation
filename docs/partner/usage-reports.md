# **Usage Reports**

*Select organization* for a better overview of Projects.

For every *Project*  you can see its *TCU* for time period limited by *Start Date* and *End Date*.

Sort data by *Project* or *TCU* and filter them by choosing available or deleted projects.


**TCU**

* Taikun Compute Unit
* &#x20;total CPUs and GB of RAM used in Project (TCU = CPU + RAM (in GB))

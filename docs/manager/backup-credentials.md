# **Backup Credentials**

## **Create new credentials**

<figure markdown>
  ![Add Credentials](https://cloud.tcpro.cz:30100/swift/v1/KEY_c5d050a1634d4ed1984f3844813f1a1d/doc-images/manager/backup-credentials/add-backup-credentials.png "Add Backup Credentials")

*S3 Name* - name for backup credentials (3-30 characters)

Fill the remaining S3 data from Amazon and add new backup credentials. See [**endpoints**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html) from AWS.

**Invalid S3 credentials** error can pop up if you fill in wrong/non-existent credentials.

After you add the credentials, you can backup the project by [**Enable Backup**](../projects/project-details-k8s/#enabledisable-backup) and add [**Backup Policy**](../projects/project-details-k8s/#backup-policy).

## **Backup Credentials**

Use the search field for finding the credentials needed.

Every Credential has its:

* ID
* Organization
* S3 Access Key ID
* S3 Endpoint
* S3 Name
* Associated Projects
* Actions

*ID* and *Organization* are immutable.

*S3 Access Key ID*, *S3 Endpoint* and *S3 Name* are security credentials.

In *Associated Projects* are listed all projects using these backup credentials.

*Created By* informs you who has made the last change.

Look [**here**](../../guidelines/create-credentials/where-to-find-credentials#aws), if you don't know where to find your AWS credentials.

By expanding the table, you can see the last modification made (*Last Modified*, *Last Modified By*).

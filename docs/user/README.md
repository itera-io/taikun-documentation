With user role you don't have that much privileges and option like *manager* or* partner* role, but you can create clusters and manage them, see the overview of projects, servers or cloud credentials for your organization, manage your account and more.

In this guideline you can see how to login, use the dashboard or create a cluster.

Visit [**Login**](login/), [**Dashboard**](dashboard/), [**Projects**](projects/) or [**My Profile**](my-profile/) to see more.

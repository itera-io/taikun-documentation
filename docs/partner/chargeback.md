# **Chargeback**

*Select organization* for a better overview of Rules.

The **Chargeback** tab is the overview of prices for every billing rule. The [**Billing rules**](../billing-rules) calculate the price from the moment they were assigned to the organization. Here you can set a real billing period. Change the *Start date* and *End date*, you can adjust the measured time period (for example from the beginning to the end of the month).

In the table there are presented:

* Rule Name
* Price
* Start Date
* End Date
